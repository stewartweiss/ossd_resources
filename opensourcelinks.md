# A Compilation of On-line Open-Source-Related Resources

This is a collection of links to online resources related to open source.
It is organized by topic to the extent that this is possible, as sometimes 
a website may be placed into multiple categories.  This is by no means
a thorough list; it is intended to include those that are either important
or provide many services and resources for those interested in all things
open source. 

##  Open Source Supporting Institutions and Organizations
These websites are the landing pages of important organizations that have
been supporting the Open Source movement, or that provide useful 
resources such as tutorials, guides, links to other resources, and so on.

* [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/ )
publishes stories about creating, adopting, and sharing open 
source solutions. It provides many resources for and about 
open source and the "open source way", as well as various other useful 
resources.
The open source way is about applying the principles of open source software development beyond software. 

* [opensource.org](https://opensource.org)
is the website for the **Open Source Initiative** (OSI), which is a 
non-profit corporation with global scope created to educate about 
and advocate for the benefits of open source and to build bridges among different constituencies in the open source community.
It has many valuable resources on its website.

* [openhatch.org](https://openhatch.org/ openhatch.org)
is the website of **OpenHatch**, a non-profit organization whose goal is to
lower the barriers to entry into the open source community and increase its 
diversity. As they put it, they are 
> dedicated to matching prospective free software contributors 
> with communities, tools, and education.

* [fsf.org](https://www.fsf.org/)
is the website of the **Free Software Foundation**. The Free Software
Foundation (FSF) is a non-profit organization founded by Richard Stallman 
in 1985 to support the free software movement, which promotes the 
universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software.
The FSF sponsors the GNU project and publishes the many different forms
of the GNU General Public License. It also  maintains the **Free Software Definition**.

* [sfconservancy.org](https://sfconservancy.org/)

maintained by the federal government. As they put it, it 
"leverages the power of code sharing and collaboration to 
help the U.S. Government cut down on duplicative software development 
and save millions of taxpayer dollars for the American people."
